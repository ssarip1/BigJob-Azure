Many applications are computationally intensive, requiring hundreds, if not thousands of processors. Common and not so common applications include
weather forecasting, molecular modeling, simulations, banking, etc. One such application is Replica-Exchange Molecular Dynamics (RE) . The RE methods
represent a class of algorithms that involve a large number of loosely coupled ensembles, called replicas. By loosely coupled, we mean that the replicas need to
communicate with each other and are bound to one-another in some way. The replicas are essentially the same simulation, but with minor dierences, such as
temperature, etc. RE simulations are used to understand a range of physical phenomena ranging from protein folding dynamics to binding anity calculations.

In RE, each replica could be a molecular-dynamics application. RE is a bit more complicated than a straightforward computationally intensive application,
in that after each run the replicas communicate with other replicas and exchange information such as energy or temperature and restart. There could be tens or
hundreds of coupled-ensembles in a simulation. In addition, each MD application typically needs a lot of processing power. To solve this kind of computation-
ally intensive problems, researchers use powerful computers called supercomputers or high-performance computers (HPC). These machines are very powerful and
expensive. Government, military and corporations commission special-purposemachines, but individual researchers usually cannot aord them. Individual re-
searchers use shared resources, provided by universities and national scientific research grids such as the FutureGrid, Teragrid , LONI, etc. The shared
resources operate under certain policies and guidelines, which the user needs tofollow.
